read xlm marker (indicating MB ID)

for each motherboard:
    read short dummy
    read short dummy

    if the xlm marker doesn't match MB xlm markers
        unpack returns false

    read int number of strips read
    (supposed to be %4 = 0, else unpack returns false)

    read short chipWords (maybe this happens?)
    read int numberOfWords (maybe this happens?)

    if (number of strips is too many || not divisible by 4)
        unpack returns false (bad buffer)

    read (5 byte) dummy (maybe this happens? wtf is this?)

    for every 4th strip
        read short id (chip number = id[0]&0x1FE0)>>5; chanNum = id[0] & 0x1F)
        read short uncalEnergy
        read short unCalEnergyLowGain
        read short uncalTime
    
        remap chanNum= (NUMBER_OF_STRIPS-2) - 2*chanNum + chipNum%2
        remap chipNum=chipNum/2 + chipNum%2
    
        if this chipboard is a front chipboard
            chanNum = (NUMBER_OF_STRIPS-1) - chanNum
    
        error checking: unpack returns false if chanNum or chipNum too big
    
        if this is a front chipboard
            calculate calibrated energies
            fill the front histograms (raw and calibrated)
    
            if within uncalibrated energy gates
                add event data to telescope uncalibrated event data structure
    
            if within calibrated energy gate
                add event data to telescope calibrated event data structure
    
        else do the same damn thing for the backs!

unpack returns true
