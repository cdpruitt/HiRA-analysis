hira::hira
    initialize histo filling class
    initialize TDC

    map telescope number to MB and chipboard numbers
    map telescope number to CsI number and 'channel' (whatever that is) 
    read in calibrations:
        for each strip (front and back) on each telescope:
        get time and energy calibrations (each a slope and an intercept)

    initialize telescopes
    set telescope Csi-to-strip correspondence    

hira::unpack
    unpack silicons (HINP4) and unpack CsIs

hira::unpack CsIs
    read ADC and TDC data from input stream, and store in telescopes

hira::unpack silicons (HINP4)

hira::~hira
   compute and output low/hi gain correlations (slopes and intercepts) 
   delete telescopes
