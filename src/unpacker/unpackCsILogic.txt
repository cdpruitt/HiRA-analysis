for each ADC
    read long f (to check for some sort of failure mode)
    if f == 0xFFFF
        some kind of failure mode...
        continue to next ADC

    read ADC event data
    for each ADC channel triggered:
        if channel overflow or underflow
            continue to next channel
        store ID for this channel
        store uncalibrated energy for this channel

        if channel ID < total number of CsIs
            use channel ID and CsI Mapping to get CsI ID and telescope #
            store CsI ID, uncalibrated and calibrated energies
            fill histos with CsI ID, uncalibrated and calibrated energies
            if uncalibrated energy within gate
                increment CsI multiplicity
                add CsI event data to telescope

        if CsI ID > TOTAL_CSIS and also < TOTAL_CSIS+EXTRA_CSIS
            fill histos with extra CsI uncalibrated energies
    
    fill CsI Multiplicity histo
    read short f twice (check for some sort of failure mode)
    if f == 0xFFFF
        some kind of failure mode...

for each TDC
    read long f (to check for some sort of failure mode)
    if f == 0xFFFF
        some kind of failure mode...
        continue to next ADC

    read TDC event data
    for each TDC measurement (i.e., one per enabled TDC submodule)
        store channelID
        store uncalibratedTime
        fill histo with uncalibrated time
        store additional time channels (e.g., RF Scintillator, A1900, Cyclotron RF)

    read short f twice (check for some sort of failure mode)
    if f != 0xFFFF (maybe?)
        some kind of failure mode...

mate ADC and TDC data for each channel
store joint ADC and TDC data in the appropriate telescopes
